Step 1:Assembling the Robot
Fix the wheels on the chassis.
Mount the DC motors on the back wheels and use dummy wheels for the front.
Mount the L293D IC on the breadboard and place it on the chassis
Place the Arduino on the chassis and make the connections of L293D as follows
4,5,12,13 to GND
1,9,16 to VCC(5V)
3,6 to left motor(output)
11,14 to right motor(output)
2,7,10,15 to pins 8,9,10,7 of Arduino(inputs)
8 to 9V battery

Step 2: Determining the Direction of Robot
Basically, the motor rotates when the inputs supplied are opposite.
Forexample,high, low may rotate the motor in clockwise while low, high in
anti-clockwise. If both inputs are same then motor does not rotate. Thecode will
help to determine for what inputs for the 2 motors will the robot move forward
it in Arduino IDE In my case it was observed that the bot will move forward pin
9 of Arduino is high, pin 8 is low (for left motor), pin 10 is high, pin 7 is low
(for right motor). Similarly for moving back the combination is
19
high,low,low,high.The bot will go right if left motor is moving and right is
stopped by giving same inputs. Similarly, for left.

Step 3: Interfacing ADXL335 With Arduino
Mount the ADXL335 and on the breadboard. The connections to Arduino
should be as follows. The Arduino should be different from the one used in step
1:ADXL335 ARDUINO
VCC 3.3 V
GND GND
X A0
Y A1
Z open
ST open

Step 4: Interfacing RF Transmitter With Arduino
Mount the RF transmitter on the breadboard in previous step and make
connections as follows.
RF transmitter Arduino
GND GND
DATA D12

Step 5: The Receiver
Mount the RF receiver on the breadboard of step 2. The connections to the
Arduino used in step 2 are
RF receiver Arduino
VCC 5V
DATA D11
20
GND GND

Step 6: Connecting the ultrasonic sensors
The ultrasonic sensors are connected to the receiver Arduino

Step 7: Connect Buzzer
Connect the +ve terminal of the buzzer to D9 of arduino as it’s the o/p pin and
grnd the –ve terminal
